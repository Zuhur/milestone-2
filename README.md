# Coast of Somalia

**Milestone 2 project for Code institute Software Development Programme.** 
A country with the longest coast in the whole of mainland Africa deserves to be showcased. As such, I have assembled a website utilising google maps API. The website consists of a home page displaying information about Somalia's coast and a varitey of images. Should further interest be shown theres a maps page to help navigate through the coastal cities.  
 
## UX
### Strategy
The aim of this website is to showcase Somalia's coast and attract travellers to visit the country by showing different types of beaches and also displaying multiple activities which can be done in the coastal cities. By visiting the website they'll be prompted to visit the country and the website is also equipped with navigating them through the cities should they visit.

#### User Stories
- As a site user, I want to understand the purpose of the website.
- As a site user, I want to easily traverse the website.
- As a site user, I want to see coastal images.
- As a site user, I want to use map to navigate different coastal cities.
- As a site user, I want to use map to see beaches available in coastal cities.
- As a site user, I want to use map to see where I can stay should I visit.
- As a site user, I want to use map to see where I can shop should I visit.
- As a site user, I want to use map to see what activities are available in the city.

### Scope
At the home page the hero image of the coast will attract the site user and give a brief glimpse to the purpose of the website, with a few scrolls the user should have a firm understanding of the page and be able to traverse the website without thought or prompting.

### Structure
The structure if the website is two-page application with the utlisation of single-page application in the first page. The first page consists of navbar, home page with the hero image, an about section followed by an explore section displaying images as a slider to avoid extensive scrolling. The second page will contain the map page and a personal navigation menu.

### Skeletal
The wireframes were designed using the balsamiq tool for different sections and screen sizes. These can be found below:

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
